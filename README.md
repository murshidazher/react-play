> A minimalistic react components library made with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com).

- **UI Component Library**â€”I wanted to use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and to build a CSS UI design system from scratch.

## Toolings
- react - 
- styled-components - for css-in-js without worrying about specificity.
- polished - for css normalization.
- styled-components-modifiers - allows to pass props to style components.
- react-spring - for micro-interaction css animations using js.
- [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/quick-start-guide/) - used for document the code and components.


## Settings
- add your own colors in `colors.js` file inside `utils`
- `npm run storybook` to run storybook
